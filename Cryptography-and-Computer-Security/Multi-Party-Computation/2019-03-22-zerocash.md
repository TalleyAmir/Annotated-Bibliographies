# Summary of "Zerocash: Decentralized Anonymous Payments from Bitcoin"

## Relevant Background

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital cryptocurrency that has various security guarantees, including transaction correctness, non-repudiation, and public verification. However, it does not guarantee its users privacy nor anonymity. Transactions consist of the transferring of coins between pseudonyms that correspond to users, but the amount of coins being transferred are not hidden, and the circulation of currency among the pseudonyms has been proven to be traceable.

## Main Contribution

This paper presents Zerocash, a protocol that runs on top of Bitcoin (or any other decentralized digital banking scheme) that allows users to

### Transaction Functionalities

* Minting
  Uses a public backing escrow pool to confirm the legitimacy of coins being converted to the Zerocash system. The minting transaction is just like any other transaction in that it posts a coin (consisting of serial number, recipient address, and any other info needed to verify the transaction such as randomness and commitment).
* Pouring
  Can have a "public" component that specifies the amount to be returned to the original form of currency.
