# Summary of "Zerocash: Decentralized Anonymous Payments from Bitcoin"

## Relevant Background

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital cryptocurrency that has various security guarantees, including transaction correctness, non-repudiation, and public verification. However, it does not guarantee its users privacy nor anonymity. Transactions consist of the transferring of coins between pseudonyms that correspond to users, but the amount of coins being transferred are not hidden, and the circulation of currency among the pseudonyms has been proven to be traceable.

## Main Contribution

This paper presents Zerocash, a protocol that runs on top of Bitcoin (or any other decentralized digital banking scheme) that allows users to send private payments, hiding the transaction recipient and amount. The scheme essentially converts Bitcoins (or whatever the unit of currency is in the underlying scheme) into Zerocash coins and posts corresponding coin commitments to a Zerocash ledger. These commitments then allow the recipient to retrieve the coins and "pour" them into new coins of specifiable denominations, thereby preventing tracability. The verification of these transactions can still be performed publicly using zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs).

## Tools

### zk-SNARKs

In general, zero-knowledge proofs are used to prove a statement to a distrustful party without revealing more information than what can be inferred from the truth of the statement being proven. What is special about zk-SNARKS is that they are both non-interactive and succinct, which means that they are easier to verify than the full proof. In this paper, zk-SNARKs are described in the context of arithmetic circuit satisfiability. This is because the statements being proven in Zerocash are NP statements that can be modelled as a non-deterministic arithmetic circuit.

A zk-SNARK is a tuple of algorithms (KeyGen, Prove, Verify) that must satisfy:

* _Completeness:_ If a statement is correct, the Verifier accepts with all but negligible probability.
* _Soundness:_ If a statement is incorrect, the Verifier accept with negligible probability.
* _Succinctness:_ The zk-SNARK itself is of constant size and the time it takes to verify the zk-SNARK is linear in the size of the input instance.
* _Perfect Zero-Knowledge:_ Any probabilistic polynomial-time Verifier cannot distinguish between interactions with a true zk-SNARK and a Simulator of the zk-SNARK that knows only the output proof of the Prove algorithm run by the zk-SNARK.

In the implementation, the authors build an arithmetic circuit for the Pour algorithm's NP statement and use the generalizable zk-SNARK methodology detailed in “Succinct noninteractive arguments for a von Neumann architecture” (ePrint 2013/879) by Ben-Sasson et al. The Pour arithmetic circuit represents the following statement:

### Decentralized Anonymous Payment (DAP) Schemes

A DAP scheme is a tuple of algorithms (Setup, CreateAddress, Mint, Pour, VerifyTransaction, Receive) that is _complete_ and _secure_. Below is a brief description of each algorithm, as well as definitions of completeness and security for DAP schemes.

* _Setup:_ This is a one-time setup protocol run by a trusted party. It generates a set of public parameters tuned to an input security parameter.
* _CreateAddress:_ A user runs this protocol based on the public parameters generated at setup time. The output is a pair of keys, one public and one private, that are used to issue and redeem coins. Users can generate as many key pairs as they like.
* _Mint:_ This algorithm takes as input the public parameters, a coin value, and a destination address and outputs a Zerocash coin and a mint transaction TX that is then posted to the Zerocash ledger.
* _Pour:_ The POUR algorithm takes as input two coins that have previously been committed to the ledger, Merkle-proofs of their validity on the ledger, secret keys of the owners of the two coins, two new public keys for the owners of the two new coins, and two new values for the new coins. It then verifies the validity of the coins and outputs two new coins (whose owners and values are as specified in the input) and a transaction TX posted to the ledger. This allows POUR to be used to join two coins into one, or split a coin into smaller denominations. It can also be used to "rename" a coin by pouring a single coin into two new coins, one whose value is simply empty. POUR can also generate public output coins to be deposited back into the original form of currency (e.g. Bitcoin).
* _VerifyTransaction:_ This algorithm only requires public information: The system's public parameters, the public ledger, and the mint or pour transaction to be verified. A mint transaction can be verified using the information in the transaction alone. In order to verify a pour transaction, the zk-SNARK contained within the transaction must verify, the Merkle root contained in the transaction must appear on the ledger, and the signature embedded in the transaction must also verify. The signature is used to prevent malleability attacks on pour transactions.
* _Receive:_ This algorithm is performed by individual users (using their public-private key pair). The user, expecting to receive a coin, scans the list of unspent coins on the ledger and runs this protocol to obtain access to the coins for which it is the intended recipient.

A DAP scheme is complete if unspent coins that have been committed to the ledger can later be spent by the owners of those coins. Furthermore, a DAP scheme is secure if it satisfies ledger indistinguishability (the ledger leaks no private information), transaction non-malleability (transactions submitted to the ledger cannot be modified before posted), and balance (a user cannot own more currency than what was minted by that user or sent to that user).

## Zerocash

Zerocash is a practical and fully implemented DAP scheme. Each of the algorithms are detailed below.

### Setup

<p align="center">

</p>

At setup time, a trusted party generates the arithmetic circuit that computes Pour, as well as the public parameters needed for the zk-SNARK which verifies Pour. Additionally, the public parameters for the key-private public-key encryption scheme and the one-time strongly-unforgeable digital signature are chosen, as well. The encryption scheme is both IND-CCA and IK-CCA.

### CreateAddress

<p align="center">
  <img width="450" src="https://github.com/TalleyAmir/Annotated-Bibliographies/blob/master/Cryptography-and-Computer-Security/Multi-Party-Computation/images/zerocash-createaddress.png?raw=true"></br>

</p>

Each user generates public and private address information consisting of encryption keys and identifying information. Specifically, the PRF used is assumed to be collision-resistant and therefore allows us to ensure that coins with public _a_ can only be spent by the user with knowledge of private _a_.

### Mint

<p align="center">

Uses a public backing escrow pool to confirm the legitimacy of coins being converted to the Zerocash system. The minting transaction is just like any other transaction in that it posts a coin (consisting of serial number, recipient address, and any other info needed to verify the transaction such as randomness and commitment).

### VerifyTransaction

<p align="center">

</p>

This algorithm unpacks each of the input variables and verifies both the signature and the zk-SNARK. It then outputs 1 if and only if both verifications pass.

### Pour

<p align="center">

</p>

Notice that pour transactions can have a "public" component that specifies the amount to be returned to the original form of currency (where *info* specifies the address of the intended recipient or location of the coins in vpub). Additionally, the nested committments ensure that the recipient's public key (and associated randomness, both embedded in _k_) are committed to, but these are not revealed when the committment is opened because the opening is simply _k_, which is the output of a collision-resistant compression function.

### Receive

<p align="center">
  <img width="450" src="https://github.com/TalleyAmir/Annotated-Bibliographies/blob/master/Cryptography-and-Computer-Security/Multi-Party-Computation/images/zerocash-receive.png?raw=true"></br>

</p>

Notice that the key-private encryption allows the true owner of the coins to retieve the coins from the ledger without revealing the coin's amount nor the identity of the user on the ledger itself. Also note that this means that the intended recipient must scan all unspent coins on the ledger in order to obtain their payment.
