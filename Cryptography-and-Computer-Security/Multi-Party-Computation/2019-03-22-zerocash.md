# Summary of "Zerocash: Decentralized Anonymous Payments from Bitcoin"

## Relevant Background

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital cryptocurrency that has various security guarantees, including transaction correctness, non-repudiation, and public verification. However, it does not guarantee its users privacy nor anonymity. Transactions consist of the transferring of coins between pseudonyms that correspond to users, but the amount of coins being transferred are not hidden, and the circulation of currency among the pseudonyms has been proven to be traceable.

## Main Contribution

This paper presents Zerocash, a protocol that runs on top of Bitcoin (or any other decentralized digital banking scheme) that allows users to send private payments, hiding the transaction recipient and amount. The scheme essentially converts Bitcoins (or whatever the unit of currency is in the underlying scheme) into Zerocash coins and posts corresponding coin commitments to a Zerocash ledger. These commitments then allow the recipient to retrieve the coins and "pour" them into new coins of specifiable denominations, thereby preventing tracability. The verification of these transactions can still be performed publicly using zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs).

## Tools

### zk-SNARKs

In general, zero-knowledge proofs are used to prove a statement to a distrustful party without revealing more information than what can be inferred from the truth of the statement being proven. What is special about zk-SNARKS is that they are both non-interactive and succinct, which means that they are easier to verify than the full proof. In this paper, zk-SNARKs are described in the context of arithmetic circuit satisfiability. This is because the statements being proven in Zerocash are NP statements that can be modelled as a non-deterministic arithmetic circuit.

A zk-SNARK must satisfy:

* Completeness
* Soundness
* Succinctness
* Perfect Zero-Knowledge

In the implementation, the authors build an arithmetic circuit for the POUR algorithm's NP statement (see below) and use the generalizable zk-SNARK methodology detailed in “Succinct noninteractive arguments for a von Neumann architecture” (ePrint 2013/879) by Ben-Sasson et al.

### Decentralized Anonymous Payment (DAP) Schemes

A DAP scheme is a tuple of algorithms (Setup, CreateAddress, Mint, Pour, VerifyTransaction, Receive) that is _complete_ and _secure_. Below is a brief description of each algorithm, as well as definitions of completeness and security for DAP schemes.

* Setup:

  This is a one-time setup protocol run by a trusted party. It generates a set of public parameters tuned to an input security parameter.
* CreateAddress:

  A user runs this protocol based on the public parameters generated at setup time. The output is a pair of keys, one public and one private, that are used to issue and redeem coins. Users can generate as many key pairs as they like.
* Mint:

  This algorithm takes as input the public parameters, a coin value, and a destination address and outputs a Zerocash coin and a mint transaction TX that is then posted to the Zerocash ledger.
* Pour:

  The POUR algorithm takes as input two coins that have previously been committed to the ledger, Merkle-proofs of their validity on the ledger, secret keys of the owners of the two coins, two new public keys for the owners of the two new coins, and two new values for the new coins. It then verifies the validity of the coins and outputs two new coins (whose owners and values are as specified in the input) and a transaction TX posted to the ledger. This allows POUR to be used to join two coins into one, or split a coin into smaller denominations. It can also be used to "rename" a coin by pouring a single coin into two new coins, one whose value is simply empty. POUR can also generate public output coins to be deposited back into the original form of currency (e.g. Bitcoin).

### Transaction Functionalities

* Minting
  Uses a public backing escrow pool to confirm the legitimacy of coins being converted to the Zerocash system. The minting transaction is just like any other transaction in that it posts a coin (consisting of serial number, recipient address, and any other info needed to verify the transaction such as randomness and commitment).
* Pouring
  Can have a "public" component that specifies the amount to be returned to the original form of currency.
