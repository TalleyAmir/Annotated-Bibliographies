# Summary of "YODA: Enabling computationally intensive contracts on blockchains with Byzantine and Selfish nodes"

## Relevant Background

Prior research on distributed ledgers aim to achieve consensus in the Byzantine model. In particular, these works strive to construct a decentralized system that maintain consistency and correctness in the presence of an adaptive, corruptive adversary. However, such schemes are not necessarily realistic. In practice, nodes are more likely to be rational and desire to maximize their own interests. The Byzantine, Altruistic, Rational (BAR) adversarial model is a more reasonable depiction of the real world. It allows nodes to model the typical Byzantine behavior talked about in the literature (an adversary that can perform the worst possible damage), but also discusses the behavior and impact of processes that are honest or self-interested.

## Main Contribution

YODA is a protocol that enables permissionless blockchains to execute computationally intensive smart contracts (CICs) in the BAR model. CICs are different from traditional transactions in that they are not necessarily easy to verify, and therefore require much more computational resources. YODA allows these contracts, such as machine learning algorithms or zero-knowledge proofs, to be computed off-chain.

## Tools

### MiRACLE

This is a sub-protocol that is run by a subset of all nodes in the system. This subset is called the Execution Set (ES), and it requires each node in the ES to execute some function of _x_, say _y(x)_. The goal is to achieve consensus on the true value of _y(x)_ with a protocol that has termination, agreement, validity (agree on the correct value with probability 1-_beta_), and efficiency (requires _optimal_ number of rounds). The protocol proceeds in rounds, as follows:

An ES is selected via Sortition (see Algorand) such that the probability of any node in the system being elected to the ES is _q_. Each node computes _y(x)_ and sends HASH(_y(x)_) to all other nodes in the ES. Then, hypothesis testing is used to determine which digest is correct. If no digest is agreed upon, a new round is invoked.

Parallel Sequential Probability Ratio Tests (Parallel SPRTs) are used to determine the correct digest in any round. This process performs a standard hypothesis test (_d_ is the solution versus _d_ is not the solution) for each digest _d_ submitted in round _i_ in parallel. Acceptance of a digest depends on whether the likelihood of one solution over all other solutions exceeds some threshold value that is calibrated according to _q_, _beta_, and the maximum number of corrupted nodes _max(f)_.

### RICE

The MiRACLE protocol assumes only Byzantine and honest nodes and therefore does not protect against quasi-honest nodes, which may attempt free-loading attacks (see below) to minimize their computation time. In particular, these nodes may take digests with high likelihoods from previous rounds and replay them in later rounds. This can cause an incorrect solution to be accepted with higher than 1-_beta_ probability. To resolve this issue, this paper presents Randomness Inserted Contract Execution (RICE) to incorporate some "randomness" into the digests between rounds and prevent these free-loading attacks.

RICE does this by using a random seed, and hashes of that seed, to inject randomness into each digest. It is important to note that _y_ is assumed to be a stateful function (like most CICs), and therefore it takes as input _y(sigma, x)_. The output is then a new state _sigma*_. Each node gossips the seed, indexed by round number and update number in that round, as well as some unique digest for the output state, denoted _root(sigma*)_. The seed is updated randomly several times throughout a round in order to maintain randomization of each intermediate state within the execution (thereby preventing free-loading attacks on the final digest).

## Enabling CICs in Blockchain

After an IT is submitted to the blockchain, a random string is generated and used to perform the sortition for the ES. It is important that the nonce string is generated after the transaction is submitted because otherwise the adversary can generate multiple nodes with keys (_sk_, _pk_) such that these nodes are elected to the ES with much higher probability.

Next, each node runs sortition to see if it is in the ES. If so, it executes the CIC and generates the RICE digest. Then, the nodes in the ES broadcast a commitment HASH(_digest_, _sort_res_) within a specified bound of time after the IT is submitted to the blockchain. Notice that this hash does not reveal who is in the ES, thereby preventing collusion among the nodes in the ES. After another specified length of time, the nodes in the ES publish the unhashed digests and their proof of ES participation _sort_res_. This delay is needed in order to guarantee that ... but still prevent Chain Forking Attacks. These time delays are specified by the IT itself according to the gas limit it has.

After the digests are broadcast, MiRACLE is run.

## Implementation and Performance

* MiRACLE
  MiRACLE was evaluated in the Byzantine model where the adversary is assumed to use the best adversarial strategy (i.e. it submits a single incorrect solution as opposed to many, which is the proven best strategy in this model). It was discovered the the empirically examined expected number of rounds needed to achiev consensus using MiRACLE closely aligned with the theoretical approximation given in the paper.
  
* RICE
  To test RICE, CICs were executed on both machines running RICE and machines not running RICE to compare total execution time. As gas usage with RICE goes up, time of execution grows notably. However, the relative increase (compared to executions without RICE) decreases for much higher gas usage (i.e. the _additional_ time it takes to run RICE decreases for much higher gas usage, thereby making RICE useful for highly intensive transactions).
