# Summary of "OmniLedger: A Secure, Scale-Out, Decentralized Ledger via Sharding"

## Relevant Background

Many works prior to OmniLedger aim to build a distributed ledger; however, these prior works exhibit a trade-off between scalability, security, and decentralization.

## Main Contribution

OmniLedger proposes multiple tools that are then used to build a scalable, decentralized ledger with various security guarantees. Several of these tools build upon previous schemes for secure multi-party computation (RandHound) and byzantine consensus (ByzCoin), while others are novel constructions (Atomix).

## Tools

### RandHound

OmniLedger achieves scalability by using a randomized algorithm for selecting a representative committee of transaction block validators. This algorithm is called RandHound, and was proposed in a paper titled "Scalable Bias-Resistant Distributed Randomness" in 2017. RandHound uses the pigeonhole principle to ensure that at least one honest party contributes to the multi-party computation, guaranteeing that the output is necessarily random and cannot be biased. Cryptographic sortition (see Algorand review) is used to select a single validator to play the role of leader and invoke the RandHound algorithm. The output of the coin-toss (with its correctness proof) is then broadcast to all parties and the random bits are used to assign individual parties to shards. 

The security of this shard-assignment algorithm relies on both the security of RandHound and Algorand's cryptographic sortition. Randhound guarantees that the adversary cannot bias the output randomness and cryptographic sortition guarantees that only one leader is elected verifiably. If the leader is corrupted, then the only risk is that the adversary withholds the coin-toss. In this scenario, the protocol times-out after a fixed period, at which point the protocol is re-run from the start. The expected number of times the protocol will need to be re-run until an honest leader is elected is probabilistically bounded.

RandHound was selected to be used for the purpose of random coin generation because it is both scalable and distributed, and has adequate security guarantees. Moreover, it has open-source code and was therefore able to be used for testing OmniLedger's performance in implementation.

### ByzCoinX

ByzCoinX is closely modelled after ByzCoin's (2016) Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocol. The additions made to this protocol by OmniLedger increase the protocol's robustness to denial of service attacks and increases performance by resolving transaction conflicts in real time to allow for parallel computation.

The original ByzCoin protocol uses a tree-like structure to communicate, which enables the system to achieve high scalability at the expense of robustness. In particular, if the adversary succeeds in faulting the system, the protocol falls back on an all-to-all communication system. Instead, ByzCoinX uses a two-level tree structure that is created by using the RandHound coin-flip to randomly assign validators within a shard to groups. Within each group, a validator is chosen at random by the protocol leader (from RandHound) to be the liason between the protocol leader and the members of that group. If the group leader is corrupted (does not answer within the timeout period or acts dishonestly), the protocol leader selects another validator to represent that group.

In order to attain parallelization, OmniLedger implements a data structure that stores block transactions in the nodes of a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The graph is structured such that transactional dependencies are reflected by the directed edges. For the graph to be correct, two invariants must always hold true: (1) The same UTXO cannot be spent in two different transactions concurrently and (2) A UTXO from one transaction's output cannot be input to another transaction until the first transaction has been committed to the ledger. The DAG preserves these two restrictions.

### Atomix

Atomix is a Byzantine Shard Atomic Commit protocol that enables OmniLedger to perform and commit transactions across multiple shards (as is likely the case for most transactions in practice). Furthermore, it prevents double-spending and ensures that unspent currency from failed transactions are not forever locked. It does this using a three-step protocol in the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model that consists of:

+ Initialize: A client creates a cross-shard transaction by gossiping the request to a subset of "input shards."
+ Lock: For each input shard, the input shard leader verifies the transaction. If successful, the leader commits it to the shard's ledger, issues a proof-of-acceptance, and marks the UTXOs as spent. Otherwise, it issues a proof-of-rejection.
+ Unlock: There are two cases. Either the transaction was successful (which happens if _and only if_ every input shard leader issued an acceptance of the transaction) or it was not. If the transaction succeeded, then the client commits the transaction to some "output shards." Otherwise, the client aborts the transaction and marks the UTXOs as spendable.

## Throughput Optimizations

### State blocks

State blocks are used to mitigate the high cost of updating or bootstrapping validators. A state block summarizes the state of a single shard in a given epoch. The state block consists of a Merkle hash of the UTXOs at the end of the given epoch, on which the validators run a consensus protocol. If consensus succeeds, the state block becomes the genesis block of the next epoch. The regular blocks of the prior epoch plus the corresponding state block allow for quick validation. In addition, a skipchain linking structure allows for fast backtracking through time to validate series of transactions.

The computation of the state block itself can take some time (the typical epoch lasts approximately one day) and so in order to improve latency, the next epoch begins with an empty state block. Once the state block for the previous epoch is completed, it is validated, added to the ledger, and given a pointer to the empty placeholder block, as well as the previous epoch's state block. 

### Optional trust-but-verify validation

OmniLedger prioritizes security over scalability and is therefore better apt for larger, more expensive transactions. However, in order to accomodate user-needs, OmniLedger offers an optional trust-but-verify validation mechanism which allows smaller transactions to verify as quickly as in real time. "Optimistic validators" perform an initial consensus protocol on a transaction and then "core validators" verify and finalize the transaction. The optimistic validators are smaller groups of validators and are therefore more suceptible to failure; however, such failures are then detected by the core validators, at which point any adversarial parties can be identified and later banned from performing computations. This means that it is not in the adversary's best interest to interefere in computations of small transactions.
