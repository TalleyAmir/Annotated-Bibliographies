# Summary of "OmniLedger: A Secure, Scale-Out, Decentralized Ledger via Sharding"

## Relevant Background

Many works prior to OmniLedger aim to build a distributed ledger; however, these prior works exhibit a trade-off between scalability, security, and decentralization.

## Main Contribution

OmniLedger proposes multiple tools that are then used to build a scalable, decentralized ledger with various security guarantees. Several of these tools build upon previous schemes for secure multi-party computation (RandHound) and byzantine consensus (ByzCoin), while others are novel constructions (Atomix).

## Tools

### RandHound

+ cryptographic sortition

### ByzCoinX

### Atomix

## Throughput Optimizations

### Optional trust-but-verify validation

### Parallelization

### State blocks

## Performance
