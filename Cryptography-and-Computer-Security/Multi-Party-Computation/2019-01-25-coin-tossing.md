# Summary & Review of "Leakage-Resilient Coin Tossing"

## Relevant Background

Leakage-resilient coin tossing is an important cryptographic tool that allows a group of entities to jointly compute and agree upon a fixed amount of randomness.

## Main Contributions

This paper offers a distributed algorithm for computing unbiased coin tossing of $m$ fair coins among $n$ parties in $O(1)$ rounds, allowing for a fraction $\lambda$ of each party's local state to be leaked to an adaptive adversary.

## Tools

### Oblivious verifiable secret sharing
### Disjoint committee election
### Robust multi-source extractor
