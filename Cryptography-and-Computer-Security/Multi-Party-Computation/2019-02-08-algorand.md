# Summary of "Algorand: Scaling Byzantine Agreements for Cryptocurrencies"

## Relevant Background

Blockchain is a publicly verifiable record of transactions that is distributed, decentralized, and non-repudiable. In recent years, this technology has been used to develop electronic cryptographic currencies, and has also been applied to various other use cases in banking and healthcare. The security of these systems relies on the infeasibility of intensive cryptographic computations. Current research in this area aims to improve the time-complexity of such systems without compromising the various security properties of the blockchain.

## Main Contribution

This paper offers a new cryptocurrency called Algorand which uses cryptographic sortition and a novel Byzantine agreement protocol (a main contribution of the paper called BA\*) to achieve higher transaction throughput and a shorter latency period than Bitcoin.

## Tools

### Cryptographic Sortition

Cryptographic sortition is an algorithm for randomly selecting a subset of users from a universe of users based on each user's associated weight and private key. In this scheme, the "weight" of each user corresponds to the fraction of currency in circulation owned by that user. This algorithm uses verifiable random functions to randomly select a hash from a random seed, as well as a proof that the hash corresponds to that seed. Then, the hash is mapped to one of the users based on intervals of numbers assigned to each user with sizes corresponding to the user's weight.

Sortition is performed in this manner because it helps achieve two desirable results. The first is that, according to this protocol, users are selected with probability proportional to their weight, as needed, in a non-interactive but verifiable way. Second, the adversary, without knowledge of the private key used to compute the verifiable random function, cannot anticipate which users will be selected better than guessing totally randomly based on the weight of each user.

### Block Proposal

The cryptographic sortition tool described above is used to select committee members to perform BA\*, described below. The members of the selected committee broadcast blocks to be added to the blockchain, and then BA\* is used to achieve consensus on the proposed block. A block must be proposed in every round in order to satisfy liveness, and so sortition uses parameters that guarantee that at least some threshold number of users on the selected committee in each run of this algorithm.

Even if a disproportionate number of members in the selected committee are malicious, the worst possible outcome is that multiple blocks will be proposed upon initializing BA\*. As shown below, this will cause the committee to agree on an empty block which does not result in a false transaction being posted to the ledger. Furthermore, this happens only a small fraction of the time.
