# Summary of "Algorand: Scaling Byzantine Agreements for Cryptocurrencies"

## Relevant Background

Blockchain is a publicly verifiable record of transactions that is distributed, decentralized, and non-repudiable. In recent years, this technology has been used to develop electronic cryptographic currencies, and has also been applied to various other use cases in banking and healthcare. The security of these systems relies on the infeasibility of intensive cryptographic computations. Current research in this area aims to improve the time-complexity of such systems without compromising the various security properties of the blockchain.

## Main Contribution

This paper offers a new cryptocurrency called Algorand which uses cryptographic sortition and a novel Byzantine agreement protocol (a main contribution of the paper called BA\*) to achieve higher transaction throughput and a shorter latency period than Bitcoin.

## Tools

### Cryptographic Sortition

Cryptographic sortition is an algorithm for randomly selecting a subset of users from a universe of users based on each user's associated weight. In this scheme, the "weight" of each user corresponds to the fraction of currency in circulation owned by that user. This algorithm uses verifiable random functions to ...
