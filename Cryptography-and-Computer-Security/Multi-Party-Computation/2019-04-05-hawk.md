# Summary of "Hawk: The Blockchain Model of Cryptography and Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts"

## Relevant Background

Blockchain technology can be used to perform transactions via a distributed, decentralized mechanism with certain security guarantees (such as nonrepudiation and public verifiability). However, such systems do not allow users to transact anonymously nor privately. We have seen newer systems, such as Zerocash, that enable this kind of functionality, but systems like Zerocash are not programmable (i.e. it cannot be outsourced by a user without knowledge of the cryptographic infrastructure). Likewise, programmable systems such as Ethereum do not have anonymity nor privacy guarantees.

## Main Contribution

Hawk offers a programmable logic for implementing secure, decentralized, private transactions assuming access to a trusted available public ledger. This application can be used by any programmer without a background in cryptography to implement cryptographically secure and privacy-preserving smart contracts. Furthermore, the paper in which Hawk is introduced also gives a formal outline of the blockchain model of cryptography, defining function wrappers and cryptographic abstractions of private transactions.
