# Summary of "Hawk: The Blockchain Model of Cryptography and Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts"

## Relevant Background

Blockchain technology can be used to perform transactions via a distributed, decentralized mechanism with certain security guarantees (such as nonrepudiation and public verifiability). However, such systems do not allow users to transact anonymously nor privately. We have seen newer systems, such as Zerocash, that enable this kind of functionality, but systems like Zerocash are not programmable (i.e. it cannot be outsourced by a user without knowledge of the cryptographic infrastructure). Likewise, programmable systems such as Ethereum do not have anonymity nor privacy guarantees.

## Main Contribution

Hawk offers a programmable logic for implementing secure, decentralized, private transactions assuming access to a trusted available public ledger. This application can be used by any programmer without a background in cryptography to implement cryptographically secure and privacy-preserving smart contracts. Furthermore, the paper in which Hawk is introduced also gives a formal outline of the blockchain model of cryptography, defining function wrappers and cryptographic abstractions of private transactions.

## Tools

### The Blockchain Model of Cryptography

* Components

  Blockchain systems use epochs, or _rounds_, to track time, and the state of the blockchain is public, meaning that any user can view the public ledger as well as the state of any participant, or _miner_, contributing to the blockchain. Messages delivered in one round are not received until the next round (thus the adversary can reorder messages, but we assume messages are not dropped). Identities interacting with the blockchain are pseudonymous, and users can generate polynomially many pseudonyms for themselves.

* Function Wrappers

  The paper defines function wrappers that transform a program into a generic protocol compatible with the generic blockchain framework it provides. This is to enable the reader to generalize their findings to arbitrary blockchains, ideal programs, and user-end programs. Moreover, these function wrapper supply additional functionalities beyond the programs which they wrap, such as timer activation points (to simulate a clock).

* Contributions

  This generic formulation of the blockchain model allows users to use this model to run arbitrary Turing-complete programs without needing to resort to previous, incompatible implementations of blockchains (such as Bitcoin). As a consequence, the functions supplied by this paper are often more cryptographically efficient for the purposes to which they are applied and are proven secure in the Universal Composability framework.

## Implementation and Performance

Hawk is implemnted in two parts: the public component is written in Serpent and is compatible with existing public blockchains whereas the private component is written in C and is given as input to the Pinnochio arithmetic circuit compiler. For this reason the private smart contracts in this system are limited by the functionality of Pinnochio (i.e. they cannot handle dynamic-length loops). The resulting arithmetic circuit is then augmented with the blockchain (e.g. Ethereum) by adding an opcode to the language that signifies the need for a zkSNARK, drawn from Libsnark.

In Table 1 shown below is the performance of the given functions in Hawk that are computed using SNARKs. The _mint_ function is not included because it need not be computed with a SNARK (since minting does not require privacy from a non-privacy-preserving system).

In addition, the SNARK-compatible optimizations made by Hawk show drastic improvements in efficiency, as shown in Figure 8 below:
